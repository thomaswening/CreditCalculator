# CreditCalculator
Application for the calculation of an annuity loan

## Description
*CreditCalculator* can be used to simulate different scenarios for an annuity loan. 
Asides from finding it a useful tool, I work on this project mainly to hone my WPF skills.

## Features
Given a set of input parameters, *CreditCalculator* determines the either the credit period or the annuity.
Moreover, the last payment, total paid interest and the total payments are calculated.

## How to use
Just compile and run. You type in the necessary parameters and the calculation is done automatically.

## Technologies
I use C# for the backend logic and WPF for the frontend.
