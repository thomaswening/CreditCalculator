# CreditCalculator
Application for the calculation of annuity loans.

## Description
*CreditCalculator* can be used to simulate different scenarios for annuity loans. By typing in a range of parameters, the user can calculate the remaining quantities.

## Features
Given a set of input parameters, *CreditCalculator* determines the either the credit period or the annuity. Moreover, the last payment, total paid interest and the total payments are calculated.

## Upcoming features
- Use of different currencies, definition of presets
- Comparison of a given set of parameters with another, display of parameter differences, e.g. how does the credit period change when the annuity is increased from X to Y EUR
- Save and Open calculations
- Graphical representation of how amounts of repayment and interest change over time

## How to use
Just compile with .NET SDK and run. You type in the necessary parameters and the calculation is done automatically.

## Technologies
I use C# for the backend logic and WPF for the frontend.
